## Problem 1

```{r}
#Load libraries needed
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)

```



```{r}
# Load data and tidy it
homi = read_csv("homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "), 
         bin_sol = (disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
         victim_age = replace(victim_age, victim_age == "Unknown", ""),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_sex = replace(victim_sex, victim_sex == "Unknown", ""),
         victim_race = replace(victim_race, victim_race == "Unknown", ""),
         bin_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", ifelse(victim_race == "", "","nonWhite"))) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"))) 

```

```{r}
# Fit logistic regression and save it
sol_fit_Bal = homi %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  glm(bin_sol ~ victim_age + bin_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())

  
# Clean results and add estimates and CIs for ORs. OR = exp(b1)
library(MASS)

  broom::tidy() %>% 
  cbind(exp(confint(sol_fit_Bal))) %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>% 
  filter(term == "bin_raceTRUE") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
# Build logistic regression for every cities, generate adjusted ORs and CIs.
homi %>%
